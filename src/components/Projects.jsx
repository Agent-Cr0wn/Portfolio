Additionally, I implemented a web application that allows users to buy and sell stocks, a login and registration system that stores user passwords securely, a 'quote' feature that allows users to get the latest stock price for a given stock symbol, a 'history' feature that shows a user's transaction history, and a 'cash' feature that allows users to add or withdraw funds from their account.",

I kept a log of all SQL queries that I ran on the database and added comments above each query describing my thought process. Once I solved the mystery, I completed each of the lines in a text file with the name of the thief, the city that the thief escaped to, and the name of the thiefâ€™s accomplice who helped them escape town.",
